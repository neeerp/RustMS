//! Messages exchanged between actors, and the handles used to send them.
//!
//! Topology (arrows are channel sends):
//!
//! ```text
//!   ClientActor ──► FieldActor        (its current map: chat, movement, NPCs)
//!   ClientActor ──► WorldDirectory    (name lookup: whisper, world broadcast)
//!   FieldActor / WorldDirectory ──► ClientHandle (try_send, never awaited)
//! ```
//!
//! Clients await their sends into fields and the directory (bounded
//! backpressure), but fields and the directory never await a client: a client
//! whose queue is full is kicked instead. That makes wait cycles impossible.
